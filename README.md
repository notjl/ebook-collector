It is **advised** to use [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) as a packaging system to ensure system and package compatibility. Make sure you have `Python 3.10.4` installed to start. To begin:
```
$ pip install pdm
$ pdm --pep582
$ pdm plugin add pdm-vscode # This is to assume you are using VSCode / Code - OSS

// Restart shell / terminal

$ git clone git@github.com:CPE025-Team-6/ebook-collector.git
$ cd ebook-collector
$ pdm install
```
These instructions assume you are using VSCode / Code - OSS as IDE, if not follow [Working with PEP582](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/usage/pep582/) for PEP582 IDE Support.
